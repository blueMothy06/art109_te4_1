Sustainable Web Manifesto
      It relates to artists because most art is an area that is largely for the mind. It is for self expression, entertainment, to promote a message, or simply a place to try out things with no real emotional connection to it. Art has a purpose, but it does use resources in a manner that cannot always be reused and I do not want my artwork to be wasteful or any more damaging than it needs to be. As an artist, it is important to use our resources wisely, so we do not hurt other people in the process of our art.
      
Part Two
- After looking through these websites, I lean toward designs with darker backgrounds with light-colored text, since they seem both casual and artsy to me
- I’ve seen a lot of websites where the text takes up a lot of horizontal space, which is something I’ve shied away from in my own websites, but I like how compact it looks
- I like Eric Xia’s blog where there’s so many things going on at once that it’s very chaotic in an organized way.
